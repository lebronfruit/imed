cards are filled from answering questions right

separate server from client
-make a serever handling everything

-move gui and drawing methods and systems into client

client.currentplayer = player.A

client.guiupdate()
	--relating to client.currentplayer
	--calculate pawns position relatively to client.currentplayer


Player.getOrientatedPosition(x, y)
	return this.orientation === 0 ? [x, y] : [x, canvas.height - y]
PlayerA.orientation = 0
PlayerB.orientation = 180
client.playas(Player.A)
client.playas(Player.B)

FIRST TEST -FLIP TOWERS related to currentplayer

make game server compatible with nodejs









enemy can spawn pawns AI bot




clue system (constesting questions)

que hace el aciclovir?

canvas class (relative sizes behavior)



you click in an area of screen and display the card from the pawn inside

getting the answer right will give you a counter card from the oponents enemy into your deck pile 

if you use all your cards you run out of cards and can't do any more attacks
untilt you contest your oponents' cards you can get more cards, however eleixir will be regening anyway

//pawns attack towers but can't hit
hypothesis: distance calculations are not correctly gotten from screen,
acorrding to the player's getOrientedPos method   
--getOrientedPos is the same in all players
--information passed through getOrientedPos is wrongly biased
--FIXED: min and max positions are not peprfectly chosen when 
using getOrientedPos, must do manually, also removed width and height for this calc
on Tower.js LINE 199

--pawn kills tower, and keeps attacking it after the tower is destroyed
hypothesis: tower is not removed from player.EnemyService.towerList

--enemy towers from currentplayer do not shoot currentplayer's pawns
but currentplayer towers do shoot enemy pawns
HYPOTHESIS: tower does fire projectioles, but projectile's
both spawn & aim coords is wrong

--currentpayer towerse shoots to enemy pawns
but enemy towers shoot to currentplayer's pawns in the wrong direction
projectile spawn coords are right on the enemy towers's, 
hypothesis: deltaposition is wrong, thus targetcenter and pos
retrieved from getOrientedPos is wrongly used:
	- targetcenter position is right.
	- projectile starter position is right
	-deltaPosition is wrong
FIXED: LINE 56 Tower.js, fifxing substraction order on deltapositionRaw into 
deltaposition: reason, substraction different when obtaining out of screenpos
NOTE: must add a method to make substractions out of getScreenPos coords translation

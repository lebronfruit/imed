ADD static coord to the ViewManager and make
all the objects rely on that position, so all objects must draw
their position relative to ViewManager.viewpos


viewing CardManager seems to blend both cardmanager and 
quickstart on the background
however, quickstart which is p(1, 0) does render solo, with no issues 
positionsi on quickkmatchbutton frm quickstart does only work
when the viewpos is according to quickstart, but still
the drawings are showed behind the  CardManager smh

HYPOTHESIS: 
	0) the problem is on quickstart, that one should be removed when
	cardmanager is displayed

	a) getViewPos() method logic not working properly with
	pre-negative viewpos + actual pos of page
	
	b)
